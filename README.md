Reaxit
==============

The latest ThaliApp built on Flutter.

Getting started
---------------

1. Install Flutter using the instructions for [your platform](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Make sure to complete the setup of [Android Studio](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows#android-setup) for Android or [Xcode](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup) for iOS.
3. [Set up your favorite IDE](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio).
4. Clone this repository and open it in your IDE.
5. Run `flutter pub get` in the reaxit folder.
6. Run `flutter run` to build and start the app.

### Other commands

- To run in release mode (without debugging capabilities, so the app does not feel slow), use `flutter run --release`.
- If you've modified anything in `lib/models/*` (that uses `json_serializable`), renew the generated files with `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
- If anything does not work, run `flutter clean` and try again or run `flutter doctor -v` to check whether everything is installed correctly.
